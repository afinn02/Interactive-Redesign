  <!-- Chart 1 -->
  <div class="chart-container1">
    <div class="chart-title">Distribution of Public Schools by County and Title I Status in NYC-Area (2015-2016) </div>
    <!-- Embed your first chart. Adjust width and height as needed. -->
    <iframe class="chart-iframe" src="sunburst_chart.html" width="900" height="700"></iframe>
    <p class="caption">Caption: This starburst chart demonstrates where public schools are located throughout the NYC area, the Title 1 status of the schools, and the overall student minority population within the county. Schools with higher levels of marginalized student populations (black, hispanic, native) are more likely to be Title 1. Within integrated regions such as Essex, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Hudson, Title 1 schools have most of the minority population within the county. Non-title 1 schools tend to have more white and asian students. This data was sourced from: https://nces.ed.gov/datatools/ </p>

  <!-- Chart 2 -->
  <div class="chart-container">
    <div class="chart-title">National Hourly Wage Gap Over Time by Race & Gender</div>
    <iframe class="chart-iframe" src="line_plot.html" width="900" height="500"></iframe>
    <p class="caption">Caption: This figure shows line plots highlighting the national median wage difference between white and black men as well as white and black women. White men have the highest median wages across all years. White women have the second highest median wage, surpassing black men in 1992. Black men and women have the lowest median wages. The combined median wage reflects the median wage across the groups white men, white women, black men, and black women, regardless of the groups selected with the toggle.
